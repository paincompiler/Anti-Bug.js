### Welcome to Anti-Bug.js
This is just another npm package just for fun.

Bugs are everywhere and being created all the time.

Let's just take them seriously with a positive attitude.

### Feature
Add some magic words and pictures to the head of your code file simply.

What's more?Just take an explore with it.

### Installation
Feel free to install it like most other npm packages:

```
#sudo npm install -g anti-bug
```

### Usage
You can use this command to do some magic to your code file:

```
#anti-bug templateName fileA [fileB] ...
```

For example:

```
#anti-bug Buddha app.py
```

The "Buddha" refers to the name of the template.

Now check the `app.py` file and you will see...

Of course you can do the same thing to a whole directory's files:

```
#anti-bug templateName dirName
```
For example:

```
#anti-bug Buddha ./js
```
You can check the supported file types in [config.json](https://github.com/paincompiler/Anti-Bug.js/blob/master/config.json) and the available templates in directory [template](https://github.com/paincompiler/Anti-Bug.js/tree/master/template).

Feel free to send pull request to upload the template file (UTF-8) you want to share and set more supported file types!
